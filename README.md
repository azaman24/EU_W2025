This repository is for the winter Engineering Unleashed program, and it contains the guide to all the electronic sensors. There will be folders for each sensor, containing the wiring diagram and the micropython code. The code will work on Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers. 

ðŸš€ Features:
- Easy-to-understand wiring diagrams for each sensor
- Example code for multiple sensors
- Simple, well-documented scripts for easy learning
- Modular design for customization and expansion
