/LCD_Files/lcd.py-

This is a file that contains helper functions for the lcd program. You should not change any code in this file. This file must be on the pico for any main program to execute.

Procedure:

1) Download the lcd.py file to your computer
2) Open the file with Thonny
3) Ensure the Thonny interpreter is Running Micropython (Bottom Right Setting)
4) Do Ctrl+S or hit the save button on the top left in Thonny, and save the lcd file to the Raspberry Pico.
5) Done. Now you can make a main file and start coding

/LCD_Files/main.py

This is the main file to be run on the Raspberry Pico, assuming we are constantly feeding the pico input from the API_Test code.

Procedure:

1) Download the main.py file to your computer
2) Open the file with Thonny
3) Ensure the Thonny interpreter is Running Micropython (Bottom Right Setting)
4) Do Ctrl+S or hit the save button on the top left in Thonny, and save the main file to the Raspberry Pico, ensure lcd.py is saved as well.
5) Done. Now you can run the code on the Pico and/or make changes to main.py

/API_Files/apiTest.py

This is the apiTest file to be run on your host computer, assuming the pico is plugged in and running main.py.

Procedure:

1) Download the apiTest.py file to your computer

2) Open the file with Thonny

3) Ensure the Thonny interpreter is Running Local Python 3 (Bottom Right Setting)

4) Replace the Censored API key with your actual API key from the Google AI Studio. (Line 5)
	**If you need help with this or missed a workshop, ask a mentor!

5) When initialzing the usb (line 35), replace COM5 with the COM port that the pico is plugged into (the bottom right setting on thonny will  tell you this, ask a mentor if stuck)

6) Now ensuring main.py and lcd.py are saved to your pico, you can unplug and replug the pico into the SAME usb port. As soon as plugged in the pico will start executing main.py

7) Ensuring the interpreter is still on Local Python 3, now run the api_test code. The system should work as expected.
